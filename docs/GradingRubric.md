|  Idea / Inspiration                     | Our application is innovative and relevant in our current remote learning environments. Users can use our application to connect with peers and classmates to become 'study buddies' or even friends. Users are able to find peers and classmates that are taking the same courses as the user and the ability to filter other users by timezone facilitates forming connections with other users that can more easily communicate in real time.                                                        |
|  User Interface HTML/CSS                | We designed an attractive interface with a simple layout to reduce confusion about how to use the features on each page of the application. We used Bootstrap to implement our designs. Additionally, we designed a unqiue logo and application name.                                     |
|  CRUD operations                        | **Create**: Users can create an account with a username and password. Users can also add additional information like phone number, availability free time and the timezone they currently reside in. All the user information is stored in the UserInfo table. Users can also add information about courses they are taking like course name, name of the professor who teaches the course and days of the week the course is held. The course information into the courseInfo table. **Read**: Users can read the information of the courses they added from a table displayed on the course page. The login pages checks to see if the user already exists and logs them in. The register page checks to see if the user already exists and prevents duplicate registory. On the settings page users can view their stored user info like their availbility, timezone and phone number. On the search page user can view other user taking similar courses based on some applied filters like course name, name of the professor teaching the course, timezone of users and days the course is taught. Once the search returns users info based on filters applied users can also view the filtered users availability tables. **Update**: users can update thier user information like their availability, phone number and timezone on the settings page. **Delete**: On the courses page users can delete the coureses that they are no longer taking or enrolled in.                 | 
|  User interactivity                     | Users can update their account information by adding their availability, timezone, and phone number to their settings. They can also create and add courses to their course list (displayed in a table). Users can then search through other users of the application by filtering by course name, professor, class days, and timezone. Through this search functionality, the user can view other users' contact information (email and phone number) for forming study groups or partners and their availability in order to plan study sessions.                                               |  
|  Authentification & authorization       | Users are able to register an account with Rendevous and then login with their credentials. If a user is not registered and tries to login, they remain on the login page but have the option of redirecting to the register page to create a new account which will redirect the user back to the login page to log in with their new credentials. User passwords are stored securely.                                                 |  
| General requirements                    | Our application is user friendly - it is simple, yet effective. The application runs smoothly and is attractive in its design and interactivity. Our Javascript, HTML, and CSS are all separated into their respective files, and we do not have extraneous/unnecessary code.
