|  Idea / Inspiration                     | Our application is innovative and especially relevant in our current remote learning environments. Users can use our application to connect with people and classmates, whether to become 'study buddies' or even just friends.                                                         |
|  User Interface HTML/CSS                | We designed an attractive interface and we used Bootstrap to implement our designs. Additionally, we designed a unqiue logo and application name.                                     |

|  User interactivity                     | Users can update their account information by adding their availability, timezone, and phone number to their settings. They can also create and add courses to their course list. Users can then search for students by filtering by course name, professor, class days, and timezone. Through this search functionality, the user can view other users' contact information for forming study groups and their availability in order to plan study sessions.                                               |  
|  Authentification & authorization       | Users should be able to register an account with Rendevous, and then login with their credentials. If a user is not registered and tries to login, they are redirected to login page. User passwords are stored securely.                                                 |
