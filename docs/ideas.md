# Innovative Idea
Our project idea is to create a website where users can find study groups for their courses in a university based on preferences taken as input. It will also have the functionality of returning potential meeting times for a group based on the availability and timezone differences of the group members.

Our application takes concepts used by existing applications that allow users to find meeting times and create connections with each other through direct messaging. Our application builds upon these concepts by enabling users, specifially university students, to find other users in the same courses to form study groups based on information stored in each users' profile. 

# Important Components
One of the most important components of this application is its ability to allow users to filter through lists of other users to find those that fit the user's preferences. For instance, if a user wants to find users from the same course but that are taught by a specific professor, they can filter by professor name. If a user wants to build a study group consisting of only users in the same timezone, they can filter by timezone as well. 

Users have the option of creating group chats for communication through the application itself. Users can update their information such as time availability during a one week period, the courses they are enrolled in, and other profile details. This will allow the application to return a list of dates and times when the availabilities of the group members overlap. The groups can use this functionality to plan meetings.
