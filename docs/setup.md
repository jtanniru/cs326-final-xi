# Updates from Milestone1 and Milestone2

The amount of data taken from the user in courses.html was decreased to Course Name, Professor, and Course Days. Components that were added include inputs for data in courses.html and a table to list a user's courses. Deletion options (drop down menu with a user's courses) was also added.
